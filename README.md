## Overview

Genetic Seeker is an evolutionary simulation in which agents compete to locate a moving target. The application is built in Swing and serves as a pure Java re-implementation of the [CodeBullet project](https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Smart-Dots-Genetic-Algorithm-Tutorial/tree/master/BestTutorialEver) done in Processing.

## Evolutionary Design

- **Fitness-proportionate selection.** FPS offers a balance between evolutionary pressure and genetic diversity by selecting population members with a chance proportional to their fitness (e.g. a fitness of 4 would grant twice the odds of survival over a fitness of 2).
- **Cloning with mutation.**
- **Fitness values results and efficiency.**
- **Genetic representation**
