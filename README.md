## Overview

Genetic Seeker is an evolutionary simulation in which agents compete to locate a moving target. The application is built in Swing and serves as a pure Java re-implementation of the [CodeBullet project](https://github.com/Code-Bullet/Smart-Dots-Genetic-Algorithm-Tutorial/tree/master/BestTutorialEver) done in Processing.

## Evolutionary Design

- **Selection: FPS.** Fitness-proportionate selection
- **Recombination: Cloning with mutation.**
- **Fitness: Inverse distance + step penalty.**
- **Genome: Acceleration vectors**
- **Elitism**
